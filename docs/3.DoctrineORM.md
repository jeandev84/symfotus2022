### Doctrine ORM 


1. Type Relations
```
Unidirectional     (relation added only for one entity)
Bidirectional      (relation added both entities)
Self-referencing   (relation own enity)
Eager              (load object and relation)
Lazy               (load object and initialize collection or object)
Extra lazy         (initialize full object without relations)
